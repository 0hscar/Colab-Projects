11 corrupted robots (amount is randomly generated), The tactic in this current program for the corrupted robots is just to answer randomly while the non corrupted robots chooses a \"Tester\" as soon as one is determined (Done with difference percentages between accusations and \"safe votes\"). Usually it runs between 500 - 1000 visits (20 robots) if they can determine a tester, but if the corrupted robots are lucky and votes often enough that the other one is corrupted then the visit count rises to alot of digits. Example: 7434496 visits with 10 corrupted robots, it has gotten it done with 13 corrupted so this example is based on the random in voting for corrupted robots.
